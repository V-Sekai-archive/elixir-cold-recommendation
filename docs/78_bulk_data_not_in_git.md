# Bulk Data: Not in Git

This doc lists **bulk data** that lives locally, is **gitignored**, and should be **backed up elsewhere** (e.g. external drive, cloud). Do not commit it to git.

## Inventory (as of this writing)

| Location | Contents | Size (approx) | How to get | Back up? |
|----------|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| `data/steam/` | Steam dataset: items, sequences, embeddings (.npy), fixture (from build) | ~100s MB | `mix recgpt.fetch_steam data/steam` | Optional; refetchable from HuggingFace |
| `data/recgpt_ckpt_export/` | Exported checkpoint (manifest + *.npy) for eval/serve | ~500 MB | `mix recgpt.export_ckpt --from-pt ... --out data/recgpt_ckpt_export` | Yes; save time if .pt is large |
| `data/recgpt_layer_3_weight.pt` | PyTorch checkpoint (single file) | ~500 MB | `mix recgpt.fetch_ckpt` | Optional; refetchable |
| `thirdparty/checkpoints/vae/` | VAE checkpoint for FSQ | ~10 MB | `mix recgpt.fetch_vae_ckpt` | Optional; refetchable |
| `thirdparty/checkpoints/recgpt/` | RecGPT .pt + export (manifest, *.npy) | ~500 MB | `mix recgpt.fetch_ckpt` + `mix recgpt.export_ckpt` | Yes; refetch takes time |

**Total under `data/`:** ~2+ GB (depends on what you have).

## What is gitignored

From [.gitignore](../.gitignore):

- `data/` — entire data directory
- `data/**/*.db`, `*.db-shm`, `*.db-wal` — SQLite
- `data/recgpt_ckpt_export/*`, `data/recgpt_layer_3_weight.pt`
- `thirdparty/checkpoints/vae/*.pt`, `thirdparty/checkpoints/recgpt/*.pt`, `*.npy`, `manifest.json`

So all bulk data is correctly excluded from git.

## Refetch (one command)

To recreate all bulk data from a clean clone:

```bash
mix recgpt.refetch
```

Runs in order: `fetch_ckpt` → `export_ckpt` → `fetch_vae_ckpt` → `fetch_steam`.

Use `--force` to remove existing `data/steam` and `thirdparty/checkpoints/` before refetch.
Next: `mix recgpt.first_step` (requires canonical texts; see [24 First step plan](24_first_step_plan.md)).

## How to “save but not in git”

1. **Refetch on demand** — `mix recgpt.refetch` gets everything. Or run individual tasks: `fetch_ckpt`, `fetch_steam`, `fetch_vae_ckpt`, `export_ckpt`.

2. **Back up locally** — Copy `data/` and `thirdparty/checkpoints/` to an external drive or NAS. Restore by copying back.

3. **Cloud / object storage** — Archive as tarballs; document bucket/path. Restore or refetch.

4. **What to back up first** — Checkpoint exports and Steam fixture take time to regenerate. Raw .pt and datasets can be refetched.
